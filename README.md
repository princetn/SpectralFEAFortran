 Sample Fortran code from the Spectral FEA software I implemented for 2D plane elasticity.
 This software has the following capability:
 1. use of input/output text readable files for input data and output data.
 2. through input file using a specific syntax to communicate the requested type of simulation and BC  & loading data.
 3. Static sim.
 4. Dynamic sim.
 5. Vibration
 6. Spectral FEA or regular Quad FEA.
 7. Full/Reduced quadrature for approximation of volume integration.
